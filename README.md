# Cat-Detector
This is a implementation of a deep learning model with binary classification.

The model classifies images as a cat or non cat (hence binary)
## Dataset
The dataset on which the 4 hidden layered neural network model is trained and tested is located in the dataset folder.

The dataset is divided into two parts `train` and `test`
## Model Accuracy
The model acheived a train accuracy of $98.5\%$ and a test accuracy of $80\%$. 

This project is inspired by the course `Neural Networks and Deep Learning` by Andrew N. G.
